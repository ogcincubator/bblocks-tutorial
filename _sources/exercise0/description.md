## Exercise 0 - Orientation

Goal: Understand the mechanics of Building Blocks

Its very easy, but has a few (quite standard) "moving parts".

There are also a **lot** of features and capabilities typical of a specification development and testing cycle that normally require a lot of effort and skills to manage as manual steps, that are integrated into a single workflow - all you need to do is to learn to link these together with the right metadata!

The tutorial will introduce these in a step-wise fashion - feel free to skip ahead - but if something is not clear please go back to the earlier exercises :-).

### Steps
1. Read the [Overview documentation](docs/overview) and answer the following questions to guide your discovery process:
    - How do the underlying [principles](docs/overview/principles) relate to improvement of specifications in your domain? Which best reflect the needs and understandings of your community to improve interoperability?
    - What [types of building blocks](docs/overview/types) do you need to create
    - What types of resources are you starting with?
    - What [registers](docs/overview/registers) contain Building Blocks you can reuse?
    - What technologies do you want to explore (e.g. JSON schema, JSON-LD, SHACL)
1. View the online "build" and "repository" forms of a Building Block register and learn to navigate between the two.  [Watch]()
1. Learn [how to build](docs/build/local) Building Blocks for reuse from source components.
    - note if you cannot run locally you can rely on [github automation](docs/build/github) on your own online fork of this tutorial.
