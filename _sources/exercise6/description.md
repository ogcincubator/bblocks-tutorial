## Importing and profiling from an external register

Importing from another Building Block register allows grouping of related Building Blocks into single governance environments using GIT.

This forces **transparency of reuse**, i.e. FAIR principles. 

It also means maintenance is relatively simple for static Building Blocks - such as those defining published standards.


### Steps
- review the docs on [imports](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/create/imports)
- view the import in line 17 of [bblocks-config.yaml](../../bblocks-config.yaml)
- uncomment the reference to `topo-line` in [schema.yaml](schema.yaml)
- build and view
- examine the examples and validation reports.
